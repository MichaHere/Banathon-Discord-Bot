⚠️ **This repository has been archived, no further updates will be made.** ⚠️
Due to an update in the “discord.js” library, which this code depends on, the repository would need a complete rewrite. This means that this code is deprecated, and therefore it has been decided to archive this project. Thank you for your understanding.

❗️ **Beware this code is deprecated, it has been written in *discord.js v12* and is no longer supported.** ❗️

To run the bot, you first need a view node modules. 

Requirements:

* discord.js v12

* nodejs

* ascii-table

* fs

* moment

* ms

Before you can run the bot, first edit the *bot-token* in the `config.json` file. Here you put in the token of your bot which is listed [here](https://discord.com/developers) in `Applications > [Bot Name] > Bot > (Add Bot > Yes, do it!) > Reset Token` You can also edit the bot prefix as you please. 

To run the bot, simply open a terminal, go to the folder and run `node client.js`
